# Claude Instructions

This is a personal learning project. The goal is to teach myself reinforcement learning by implementing algorithms from scratch and improving a simple MLP's performance on 2048, without following a guide — relying instead on first principles reasoning and observation of training statistics and dynamics.

**Do not attempt to optimize, refactor, or improve anything unprompted.** Only do exactly what is asked. This is intentional: the learning value comes from me making my own decisions and observing the effects.
